Normal Incedence Problem: A 50-MHz Mobile Communications' plane wave with electric field amplitude of 30 V/m is normally
incident in air onto a semi-finite conductor with εr = 1, μr = 1 and σ = 2.78 x10-3 S/m. Determine the reflection coefficient and average power densities of the incedent and reflected waves.

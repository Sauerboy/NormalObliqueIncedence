Normal Incedence Problem: A 50-MHz Mobile Communications' plane wave with electric field amplitude of 30 V/m is normally
incident in air onto a semi-finite conductor with εr = 1, μr = 1 and σ = 2.78 x10-3 S/m. Determine the reflection coefficient and average power densities of the incedent and reflected waves.

Parallel Incedence Problem: A parallel polarized beam of light with an electric field amplitude of 20 V/m is used for optical
imaging. This beam is incident in air on polystyrene with εr = 1 and εr = 2.6, respectively. The incidence
angle at the air-polysterene planar boundary is 50°. Determine the reflection and transmission coefficient, reflectivity and transmissivity, and the power carrried by the incedent, reflected, and transmitted beams if the illuminated area at the boundary is 1 square meter.
